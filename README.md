# üöÄ SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project aims to **predict the landing success of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket's first stage** using real-world launch data. The analysis covers everything from data collection and wrangling to interactive dashboards and machine learning modeling.

## üîç Objective

- Analyze Falcon 9 launches to understand patterns behind successful landings.
- Build predictive models to forecast landing success using features like payload, orbit, launch site, and booster version.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Web Technologies**: Dash, Plotly
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Folium
